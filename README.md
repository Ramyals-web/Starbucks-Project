# Study on Starbucks Nutrition

We are a small non for profit coffee roastery based in North Carolina. Our coffee has a unique taste, comes in small amounts, and is used in dark roast expresso drinks. We are searching for a successful and long term coffee shop/house that would craft a perfect cup of coffee and make a positive impact in consumers lives. Hence, this project is to study one of our potential partners, the world's largest coffeehouse chain, Starbucks.

We have 2 criterias in selecting our potential partner:
- A partner should be able to craft our coffee within healthy sugar/caloric ranges.

- Committed to ethically sourcing and roasting the highest quality coffee.

# Global and Local Presence
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)
Starbucks is the largest global coffee house. By 1986, that is 15 years of Starbucks, they just had 6 stores and only limited to Seattle.
The founders then sold Starbucks to one of it's former manager's Howard. After which, the coffee chain expanded out of Seattle to multiple states in the United States and then throughout the world.
Did you know since 1987, an average of 2 Starbucks stores have opened each day? As of 2020, the company has over 32 thousand stores in 83 countries around world of which over 16 thousand i.e. 50% of the stores are in the United States.(hover on US in first map and then randomly on other countries).
And in US, California has the most Starbucks stores which is nearly 3000(hover on California second map). next is Texas which has 1/3rd the number of stores as California.(hover on Texas second map). And the least number of stores being in North Dakota which is just 13.
Also, what we can notice here is that the central part of United states(randomly hover on to states in the central part) has less Starbucks stores when compared to east or west.
There are roughly 50% company operated stores(the individual stores usually with drive-thru) and 49% licensed stores(which are usually seen inside the airports/malls/stores). With the exception of France, Starbucks do not have franchises elsewhere in the world. 

# Average Consumer
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)
	• Who  spends more at Starbucks, female or male? This chart shows that female customers' accounts for 41.20% and male customers account for 57.20% of the data and rest chose other as gender account only for 1.43. Male spend more than female.
    
	• Majority customers for both genders are between 45 and 70 years which is almost( 60%).  The first largest group is 50 to 59(24%)  and then second highest is 60-69(20%) and then third famous age group is (40-49)(16%). Male consumption is more than female. 

	• When looking at the income distribution, females have a wider distribution of incomes and also have higher income than males and other genders. Female customers make, on average, around 71k a year, male customers make, on average, around 63k. I got more intrigue then I did research on income ranges on basis of gender.
	
	• Majority of people make 45k and 75k. And minority are making more than 100k per year, Overall, we can see that most of the female customers make between 60k — 75k, and most of customers earn 45k— 60k.  Whole, 70% of customer make between 30k-75k and rest are making more than 75K.
	


# Nutrition
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)
We had 3 hypotheses:
- The size of the beverages have a positive correlation with the sugar content and calories of the beverage.
- At least 50 of Starbucks drinks will exceed the daily recommended value for Sugar.
- Calories will have a high correlation with Sugar, Cholestrol and Total Carbohydrates.
While the analysis showed that most of the espresso drinks have lower than 30 grams of sugar, one of the most eye-opening finding for us was that 71% of Starbucks drinks of all categories of size Grande exceed daily recommended sugar amount which is 30grams/day.

We also looked at the sugar and calories per beverage category of size Grande, which gave us a bigger picture of Starbucks's current beverages and their nutrition values, specifically sugar content and calories which we compared to the daily recommended values.

Looking at the below charts we can conclude that the only "healthy coffee drinks" of Grande Size at starbucks are coffee, classic espresso drinks and iced beverages:

With the given data, The below heatmap clearly shows that the Calories has a high correlation with Sugar,Cholestrol and Total Carbohydrates.

# Final Conclusions 
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)
In our final decision, we have taken into careful consideration the nutritional value of the drinks that Starbucks offers to the coffee lovers. 

	- Our analysis showed :
		• Starbucks is the largest global coffee house
		• Everyone loves Starbucks, mostly men
		• Starbucks offers over 170 thousand customized beverages
		• While now we know that over 71% of Starbucks beverages exceed daily recommended amounts of sugar, trans fats and can be high caloric and are absolutely delicious, we identified the drinks that matter to us the most, are within the healthy range of daily limits.
		• The espresso drinks where our coffee beans would be used as main ingredient --  are the healthiest and have the lowest sugar, and  the lowest in calories.
	
	- Per this detailed report, our strategic team has a recommendation to move forward with the partnership. We would like to get your opinion and approval to make the best decision.
